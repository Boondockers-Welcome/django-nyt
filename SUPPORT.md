Getting support
===============

Please refer to our documentation before asking questions:

<http://django-nyt.readthedocs.io/>

**DO NOT USE GITHUB FOR SUPPORT INQUIRIES! USE IRC OR MAILING LIST!**

django-nyt is community based, please try to be active. If you want
help, plan to give help, too. For instance, if you join IRC, then stay
around and help others.

Please use django-wiki's IRC for getting in touch on development and
support. Please do not email or PM developers asking for personal
support.

> -   `#django-wiki` on irc.freenode.net
