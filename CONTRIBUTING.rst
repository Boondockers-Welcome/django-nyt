Support
-------

**DO NOT USE GITHUB FOR SUPPORT INQUIRIES! USE IRC OR MAILING LIST!**

Django-nyt is community based, please try to be active. If you want
help, plan to give help, too. For instance, if you join IRC, then stay
around and help others.

Issues
------

Contributions are appreciated! The following guide is a rough draft, but
please feel free to contribute to this contribution doc as well :D

When submitting an Issue, please provide the following:

-  If it's a **feature request**, then write why *you* want it, but also
   which other cases you find it useful for. Best way to get a new
   feature made by others is to motivate.
-  Think about challenges.
-  Have you read the Manifesto (below) ? New features should maintain
   the focus of the project.
-  If you encounter a **bug**, keep in mind that it's probably easiest
   to fix if a developer sat in front of your computer... but in lack of
   that option:
-  ``django-admin.py --version``
-  ``python --version``
-  ``uname -a``
-  An example of how to reproduce the bug.
-  The expected result.
-  Does the bug happen with a checkout of django-wiki's master branch?
   To upgrade:
   ``pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki.git``
